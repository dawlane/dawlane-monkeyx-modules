TO DO:
		Check for memory leaks. Kind of tricky with all the noise from Gtk and glib and the suppersion files available do not work well.
		
		Figure out why a GTK+3 application on a GTK+2 distribution has problems not detecting recent files and the miss placement of the
		file chooser dialog when GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN is used. Both issues so far are with Linux Mint.
