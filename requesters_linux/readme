Requester Linux v0.4

	The requesters module is strictly for GLFW PC Desktops. The offical release from Blitz Research only support Window and Apple OS X.
	You will need to instal the GTK+2/3 development libraries for Linux.
	To make it simple without having to hack the Linux Makefiles. Modify the files below and rebuild transcc
 	
 	In src/trans/builders directory
 	glfw.monkey modifications in GCC section:
 		Delete
 			Local ccpots:=""
 	Replace with:
 		Local OPTS:="",LIBS:=""
		Local cc_opts:=GetConfigVar( "CC_OPTS" )
		If cc_opts OPTS+=" "+cc_opts.Replace( ";"," " )			
		Local cc_libs:=GetConfigVar( "CC_LIBS" )
		If cc_libs LIBS+=" "+cc_libs.Replace( ";"," " )
	Change:
		ccopts+=" -O0"
		ccopts+=" -O3 -DNDEBUG"
		Execute cmd+" CCOPTS=~q"+ccopts+"~q OUT=~q"+casedConfig+"/MonkeyGame~q"
	To:
		OPTS+=" -O0"
		OPTS+=" -O3 -DNDEBUG"
		Execute cmd+" CCOPTS=~q"+OPTS+"~q CCLIBS=~q"+LIBS+"~q OUT=~q"+casedConfig+"/MonkeyGame~q"
		
	In targets/glfw/gcc_linux/Makefile and targets/glfw3/gcc_linux/Makefile
	Append $(CCLIBS) to LDLIBS. Note that this must be placed last. Libaries need to be linked in the correct order

	Make a back up of brl/requesters.monkey and copy the repository brl directory into modules.
	The native requester.cpp for Linux has be broken into smaller modules for easy editing.
	
	KNOWN ISSUES:
		Mouse cursor input in full screen mode will only work with GLFW 3.
		
		As there are basically two windowing systems at work. Clicking the background on a GLFW fullscreen window will select it and hide the requester.
		You can cycle through applications with Atl+Tab key combanation to bring them back into focus.
		
		Passing an hidden file will activate the hidden file switch, but you may have to manually disable it the next time the file browser opens.
		This has more to do with the file manager settings that the module. You should find the settings files that forces this in the users home ./config/gtk directory.
		
		If the distribution uses GTK+2 (e.g Linux Mint) and the compiled binary is GTK+3. Then expect issues with dialogs not showing in the centre of the display etc
		It's recommened that you use Gtk+2 as those distributions that are based on Gtk+3 should be backward compatible there is still a hell of a lot of Gtk+2 software out there.
		
		To make it consistant if a malformed or non existant directory is passes. Then the default is to use the users home directory.
		The orignal idea was to use the recent, but GTK+3 doesn't work correctly with Linux Mint. So it went out the window.
		
	USAGE RULES:
		A malformed or non existent path opens the users home directory. If there is a file there with the file name passed, it will be selected.
		Just passing a wildcard/file with a known filter extension will open the users home directory with the filter selector, else all files are displayed
		For the RequestFile function, the last field in a path will be assumed to be a file name, so to open a direcory end it with a back-slash /
		For the RequestFile function set to saving. Using a wildcard with extension will set the file name to Untitled plus the extension specified.
		Passing a hidden file will activate the Show Hidden files attribute.
		If the filter is in the filter list, then the filter selector is shown.
		Just setting the directory will open that directory and set the file name to Untitled.
		An empty filter list will show all files.
